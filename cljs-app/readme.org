* Set up

1. I've pulled in a local copy of mustache-rs. Run =wasm-pack build=
   in the [[../mustache][mustache]] directory to build the library.
2. Jack in as usual.
3. I'm using webpack to serve the app, since the http server figwheel
   provides does not serve wasm with the correct MIME type. Start it
   using =npm start=.
